# Requests of lane db

## 1. `crates/blaze-query/src/lib.rs`: `Query::Key` serializable and `'static`

```rust
type Key: Clone + Send + Sync + Serialize + serde::de::DeserializeOwned + 'static;
```

Why: a result is verified by walking its edges, and an edge names a dependency only by its
`QueryKey` (kind and content ID). When that dependency has no valid memo in the view, the
database must run it again to see whether its fingerprint changed (early cutoff), so it needs
the dependency's key itself, not its hash: after a daemon start from the image, after the
settle swap, and for any dependency the asking query never names again. The database keeps
each key's bytes (deterministic CBOR, `blaze-protocol`'s) beside its memos and in the image.
`'static` because a typed key is passed through the database's kind table as `&dyn Any`.
Every key in the plan (item keys, facts, paths, instance keys) already derives serde. The
lane's code in `crates/blaze-query/` is written against this bound: it does not build without
it.

## 2. vfs (or the coordinator's daemon glue): implement `blaze_query::Tree` over the VFS

`blaze_query::Tree` (new, `crates/blaze-query/src/tree.rs`) is how the database reads a view's
files: `file(root, path) -> Option<(ContentId, Arc<[u8]>)>` and
`list(root, path) -> Option<Vec<(String, bool)>>`, both pure functions of a root, called from
many worker threads. The VFS's nodes are content-addressed and immutable, so a handle that
shares them (not `&mut Vfs`) can answer both. Wire it in `Database::new(Config { tree, .. })`.

## 3. Coordinator, daemon wiring

- Make the daemon's database with `Database::new(Config { tree, dir, tags })` (or, at start,
  `Database::from_image_with(config, mapping)` of `<dir>/image`; on `DbError::Image` start from
  `Database::new` and rebuild from the store's results, as `docs/v2/format.md` says).
- Hand it every completion whose tag it `owns`, through `Database::complete`.
- After a cold build: `write_image`, then, once `complete` has mapped it, `settle(&mut effects)`
  swaps to the mapped image and drops the cold arenas (#1299). `reclaim` frees retired buffers
  whenever the daemon holds the database alone.
- Call `collect(kept, effects)` between requests with the roots to keep (the last build of each
  head), which also moves cold values to disk.
