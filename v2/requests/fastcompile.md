# Requests of lane `fastcompile`

The lane's crates and boundaries: `docs/v2/plan/lanes/fastcompile/notes.md`. Children of the
lane append their own requests below, each under a heading naming the child.

## 1. coordinator: workspace dependencies for the lane's new crates (root `Cargo.toml`)

What: in `[workspace.dependencies]`, beside `blaze-link`:

```toml
blaze-global = { path = "crates/blaze-global" }
blaze-hashcons = { path = "crates/blaze-hashcons" }
blaze-history = { path = "crates/blaze-history" }
blaze-inproc = { path = "crates/blaze-inproc" }
blaze-intent = { path = "crates/blaze-intent" }
blaze-lazy = { path = "crates/blaze-lazy" }
blaze-premap = { path = "crates/blaze-premap" }
blaze-stencil = { path = "crates/blaze-stencil" }
hir-ty-share = { path = "crates/hir-ty-share", version = "0.0.0" }
```

Why: the twelve changes of `docs/v2/plan/design/compile-time.md` live in these crates
(`docs/v2/plan/process/building.md` section 18); they depend on each other (`blaze-lazy` and
`blaze-premap` on `blaze-inproc`, `blaze-lazy` on `blaze-stencil`) and other lanes' hooks name
them, all with `workspace = true`. Members come from the `crates/*` glob; each crate arrives
with its `Cargo.toml` and `src/lib.rs` together. `blaze-testsel` is added here only if
`fastcompile-ident-select` creates it.

## fastcompile-ident-select 1: coordinator: workspace dependency `blaze-testsel` (root `Cargo.toml`)

What: in `[workspace.dependencies]`, beside the lane's other crates:

```toml
blaze-testsel = { path = "crates/blaze-testsel" }
```

Why: exact test selection (idea 3 of `docs/v2/plan/design/compile-time.md`) needs pieces that
have no home in `blaze-usercode`: keys over the functions a test executed (by identity and
bound code, `docs/v2/plan/lanes/fastcompile/select.md`), the record of executed functions, and
the cached mark. `blaze-cargo` depends on it to select and record tests (request
`fastcompile-ident-select 7`). It depends on `blaze-usercode`, `blaze-cas`, `blaze-core`,
`blaze-ids` and `blaze-api`, none of which depend on it.
